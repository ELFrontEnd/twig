Twig for Frontend Friends!
==========================

Well hallo there! Inside this archive, you'll find 3 things:

1) start - This is the start version of the code that's used in this screencast.

2) finish - This is the finished version of the code that we build
   in this screencast. For more details on how to run the code,
   see the README.txt file in that directory.

3) stubs - This directory contains a few files that we will use
   while building our project. For more details, see the README.txt
   file in that directory

And as always, thanks so much for your support and letting us do what
we love!
