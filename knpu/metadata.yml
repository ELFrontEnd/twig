length: 41:18
summary: |
    Welcome to Twig! If you're a frontend developer and you're using Twig
    in your project, then this course is for you! We'll talk about how to
    use Twig from the ground-up, clearly pointing out its syntax and then
    graduating to some really neat and advanced tricks. Twig is awesome to
    work with, so don't just use Twig, master it!
    
    We'll learn:

    * The Twig syntaxes: `{{ }}` and `{% %}`
    * Functions and filters
    * Debugging with the `dump()` function
    * Handling arrays and objects
    * Template Inheritance (`extends` & `block`)
    * Tests, looping tricks, and shortcut syntaxes
    * Macros (Twig functions)
    * Whitespace control, escaping and more!
    
    Ok, let's go!
